Get a list of files:
rsync -av --list-only rsync.mirrorservice.org::gutenberg.org | awk '{print $5}' > log_gutenberg

As per here: - https://github.com/openzim/gutenberg/issues/50

We build an rsync filter to exclude anything that is not a ZIP file (or text which we zip in transit depending on what the zip contains):

We can exclude old/*
Any file ending in -h (HTML)
-8 just has a different encoding - maybe exclude all files with a -
-0 = utf-8 , without - is just ASCII

May also need to exclude files.zip and files in files - maybe just exclude anything over 10Mb.

There are a few "music.zip" files - we can maybe delete these.

--exclude old/ - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/5774/rsync-excluding-a-particular-subdirectory-and-its-children-where-the-subdirect
See this guide for more rules. https://www.samba.org/ftp/rsync/rsync.html

Maybe something like this:
rsync -avm \
	--max-size=10m \
	--include="*/" \
	--exclude="*-*.zip" \
	--exclude="*/old/*" \
	--include="*.zip" \
	--exclude="*" \
	rsync.mirrorservice.org::gutenberg.org /home/ben/Data/Gutenberg

-m flag prunes empty directories

List only
rsync -avm --list-only --include="*/" --exclude="*-*.zip" --exclude="*/old/*" --include="*.zip" --exclude="*" rsync.mirrorservice.org::gutenberg.org | awk '{print $5}' > log_filtered_gutenberg


We may then need to filter based on language.

The index file is a text file that may be used to build an index.
